## Product overview


Slate Fire **INFINITY** software will reduce man hours and associated costs significantly by automating the installation process, scheduling code migrations, comparing and verifying quality assurance and giving system project metrics to product owners. Product owners will make better decisions with INFINITY installed. Trend analysis will show the value of INFINITY over time and remove mistakes that are costly to project teams on day one.

> “I’ve learned that mistakes can often be as good a teacher as success.”  
– Jack Welch, chairman and CEO General Electric

 The current Tririga installation process is manual and requires multiple teams and many hours to complete each environment. Simplify this process for your teams with IPA. Scheduling object migrations between environments gives project teams the ability to focus on *work in progress*. Creating amazing functionality for the product owners will be the task of your current professional services teams with INFINITY configured and running OPA. Additionally the metrics(Fireball) for all activities related to Tririga are easily understood and reported to all team members using Sapphire reporting.

 - **IPA** software - Installation team members can redirect focus to projects and support issues in the Tririga system rather than manual installations.
 - **OPA** software - Automated migration of packages from source to destination server(s).
 - **Fireball** software - Monitor developer and system modification across all objects.
 - **Sapphire** - Reporting for all INFINITY modules and more.
 
> Solve problems quickly, fix issues as they occur and stay on top of
> customers needs with INFINITY and all modules configuration.

### Business process flow


**INFINITY**

> ##### INFINITY makes releases easy, reliable and reduces overall cost.

 1. INFINITY and Modules combined Benefits:

     -  Achieve a built-in DevOps environment that does not require
    hours of meetings and staff time to manage.
      -  Your Tririga team can simply control Tririga processes from one place and know what is happening at all times.
      -  The amount of data and processes managed by INFINITY is truly INFINITE!
      -  There are no limits to the systems abilities, the projects can control and allow it to be continuously running on a planned basis and enjoy analysis reporting and metrics for each team members activities.
      -  Reduce the many man hours spent working in your environments as you analyse the objects that are modified by your developers. This will allow your team to adjust project timelines and realize actual development
    time expected for each customization going further.
      -  Business Logic evaluation by INFINITY will identify and reinstall all customization to your Tririga systems during upgrades. Each module can be informed by INFINITY to complete its individual jobs. If INFINITY is not configured to be aware of trending status of modules and process there is no 'Business logic evaluation'.
      -  INFINITY can capture snapshots at the start of the project and multiple times throughout the DevOps cycle and know the QA status over time. 
  
 2. INFINITY Deployment Benefits:
 
      -  Enabled new incident response model
      -  Ops-controlled access and security policy
      -  90% reduction in MTTR
      -  50% reduction in escalations
      -  55% reduction of overall support costs

 3. INFINITY Operations Benefits:
 
      -  Scale your labor and reduce costs
      -  Create standard operating procedures
      -  Safely delegate operations tasks
      -  Easy to extend and integrate
      -  Leverage modern Dev practices
      -  Improve visibility and governance


**IPA**

 - IPA software creates a Tririga deliverable that is delivered from the master server to slave servers.  After implementation, IPA will continuously monitor installations, resolve errors, and send notifications to authorized administrators.
 - IPA allows automation of the Tririga installation process and includes more frequent updates to the database.
 - IPA enables rapid deployment of Tririga across multiple servers.
 - Includes the ability to run ad hoc jobs or scheduled jobs using tools such as Rundeck or Jenkins to control the environments from one location.
 - Automation of the installation process using a continuous delivery approach ensures reliably released software at any time and provides the ability to recover from disasters.
 
**OPA**
 - Automated migration of packages from source to destination server(s).
 - Ability to create object migration from database and then trigger export from source Tririga.
 - Export to destination servers and automatic installs are possible.
 - Multiple projects are manually reviewed, if needed, before import in destination server.
 - Updates to OPA are provided for each Tririga Application and Platform version update. 

**Fireball**

 - Monitor developer modifications across all objects.
  - Time tracking for developers working in Tririga.
  -  Monitor object customization growth over time which allows forward
   planning.
   - Workflow process monitoring during heavy loads to assess and manage
   performance.
   - Monitor external staging databases.
  -  Reports are generated and emailed to Admins (Excel, Birt, and
   Tableau reports available).
  -  Updates are provided for each Tririga Application and Platform
   version update.

 
**Sapphire**

  -  Sapphire reporting reduces the need for multiple query requests.
  -  Our reporting does client side data manipulation.
  -  Users access Tririga system and the values they return are cached in their browser in JavaScript objects.
  -  This allows for decreased chatter between clients and Tririga.
  -  Manipulation of large datasets is done on the clients browser.
  -  Reporting can run alone or as a part of Slate Fire INFINITY
  -  Reports are generated and emailed to Admins (Excel, Birt, and Tableau reports available).
  -  Updates are provided for each Tririga Application and Platform version update.

 - IPA allows automation of the Tririga installation process and includes more frequent updates to the database.
 - IPA enables rapid deployment of Tririga across multiple servers.
 - Includes the ability to run ad hoc jobs or scheduled jobs using tools such as Rundeck or Jenkins to control the environments from one location.
 - Automation of the installation process using a continuous delivery approach ensures reliably released software at any time and provides the ability to recover from disasters.
 
**OPA**
 - Automated migration of packages from source to destination server(s).
 - Ability to create object migration from database and then trigger export from source Tririga.
 - Export to destination servers and automatic installs are possible.
 - Multiple projects are manually reviewed, if needed, before import in destination server.
 - Updates to OPA are provided for each Tririga Application and Platform version update. 

**Fireball**

**Infinity**

> ##### INFINITY makes releases easy, reliable and reduces overall cost.


 - **INFINITY and Modules combined Benefits:**
     -  ISS can achieve a built-in DevOps environment that does not require
    hours of meetings and staff time to manage.
      -  Your Tririga team can simply control Tririga processes from one place and know what is happening at all times.
      -  The amount of data and processes managed by INFINITY is truly INFINITE!
      -  There are no limits to the systems abilities if the projects are controlled and allowed to be continuously running and planned
    based on analysis reporting and metrics.
      -  ISS can know how many man hours are spent working in your environments and what objects are modified by your developers. This
    allows to adjust project timelines and realize actual development
    time expected for each customization.
      -  Business Logic evaluation identifies and reinstalls all customizations to your Tririga systems during upgrades.
      -  ISS can take a snapshot at the start of the project and multiple times throughout the DevOps cycle and know the QA is at

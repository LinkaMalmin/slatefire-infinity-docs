## Product overview


Slate Fire **INFINITY** software will reduce man hours and associated costs significantly by automating the installation process, scheduling code migrations, comparing and verifying quality assurance and giving system project metrics to product owners. Product owners will make better decisions with INFINITY installed. Trend analysis will show the value of INFINITY over time and remove mistakes that are costly to project teams on day one.

> “I’ve learned that mistakes can often be as good a teacher as success.”  
– Jack Welch, chairman and CEO General Electric

 The current Tririga installation process is manual and requires multiple teams and many hours to complete each environment. Simplify this process for your teams with IPA. Scheduling object migrations between environments gives project teams the ability to focus on *work in progress*. Creating amazing functionality for the product owners will be the task of your current professional services teams with INFINITY configured and running OPA. Additionally the metrics(Fireball) for all activities related to Tririga are easily understood and reported to all team members using Sapphire reporting.

 - **IPA** software - Installation team members can redirect focus to projects and support issues in the Tririga system rather than manual installations.
 - **OPA** software - Automated migration of packages from source to destination server(s).
 - **Fireball** software - Monitor developer and system modification across all objects.
 - **Sapphire** - Reporting for all INFINITY modules and more.
 
> Solve problems quickly, fix issues as they occur and stay on top of

 1. INFINITY and Modules combined Benefits:

     -  Achieve a built-in DevOps environment that does not require
    hours of meetings and staff time to manage.
      -  Your Tririga team can simply control Tririga processes from one place and know what is happening at all times.
      -  The amount of data and processes managed by INFINITY is truly INFINITE!
      -  There are no limits to the systems abilities, the projects can control and allow it to be continuously running on a planned basis and enjoy analysis reporting and metrics for each team members activities.
      -  Reduce the many man hours spent working in your environments as you analyse the objects that are modified by your developers. This will allow your team to adjust project timelines and realize actual development
    time expected for each customization going further.
      -  Business Logic evaluation by INFINITY will identify and reinstall all customization to your Tririga systems during upgrades. Each module can be informed by INFINITY to complete its individual jobs. If INFINITY is not configured to be aware of trending status of modules and process there is no 'Business logic evaluation'.
      -  INFINITY can capture snapshots at the start of the project and multiple times throughout the DevOps cycle and know the QA status over time.

### Automated Install


**Explain the need**
You’ve made the decision to bring in a software system to your operations. 
It’s new information for staff to learn and integrate into their workflow. 
Explain the rationale behind it such as the expected ROI, the efficiencies predicted
 to be gained and any other rationale that will help employees understand the need 
 for the software implementation.

**Team roles and responsibilites**
Establish the team that will be involved in training and rolling out the system. Assign roles and responsibilities and adjust any others that will occur as a result of the new system. Answer any questions team members have and bring them up to speed on any information you learned during the sales process that could be of value to them. Create a software implementation plan with predicted deadlines the company should be aware of.

**Configure the system**

ometimes software systems require adjustments to match your operations. That’s why having team members involved can help work through what needs to occur for the software to work with your operations. Whether it’s an integration with other software systems used in your business or custom feature development, time will need to be allocated to account for any configurations.  At other times, a software system can’t be configured specifically and therefore your business operations may need to be adjusted to match the software tools and the efficiencies they provide.


**Change management**
This will help with coordination and implementation of the team and project: Change can be difficult for many staff. You can read more about how to manage your staff through change in our 8 steps for managing through change in ecommerce blog found here.

**Training**

Most software companies will train the key person who will be handling the system. That person becomes the expert or “Power User” and then trains others in the company as needed. If you prefer to train all staff who would be involved at once, then check with the software provider on what training programs and roll outs they offer. Companies will have training documents available that you can use as reference. If there are some specific instructions that need to be developed for staff who may not use the system frequently, developing any training procedures/documents that are reflective of how you want your operations to run is a good starting point to ensure consistency in usage of the system.


**Conduct UAT**

This is an important step to undertake to ensure the software works as intended. It will help find any bugs, (its software, it can happen). That’s why it’s important to test out a small portion of data to see if the software processes all the information correctly. If the system it integrated with other software tools or marketplaces you will want to ensure that the systems are communicating properly.

**Coordinate Cut-over**

When it’s time to begin to move to the new software it’s a good idea to keep existing system’s information with data still available. For a short period you may be running 2 systems depending on how you decided to roll out the new software. It can take 6-12 months for users to feel fully comfortable with system with a new pieces of software and most times the historical information will need to be accessible. Especially if you are selling online and have returns or warranties to account for.



**Plan for Go-live**
A good idea is to implement a system during slower periods of the year. When companies don’t have a slow time, then planning ahead to try to account of any bumps will help. Make sure to have the implementation team ready to work with your software provider on the go-live. Check random pieces of data to see that information and data has transitioned and is processing as it should.

**Track efficiencies and measure results**
With any system you want to measure the before and after effects. You also want to establish what measures will tell you the implementation has been successful. This can include things like the ability to process more orders in a day, reduction in hourly wages paid out for overtime, or others. Continue to track and measure through the year to make sure your investment is paying off. It’s also always nice to see the benefits and be reminded of how far you’ve come and grown your business.

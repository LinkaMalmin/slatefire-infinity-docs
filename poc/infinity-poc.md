## Product overview

Our product rocks!!

Slate Fire IPA software will reduce man hours and associated costs significantly by automating the installation process, scheduling code migrations, comparing and verifying quality assurance and giving project metrics to product owners.

 The current Tririga installation process is manual and requires multiple teams and many hours to complete each environment. Scheduling object migrations between environments gives project teams the ability to focus on work in progress. Creating amazing functionality for the product owners. Add to those and metrics for all activities are tools

 - IPA software reduces the impact on existing ISS teams who currently perform manual installs. Installation team members can redirect focus to projects and support issues in the Tririga system rather than manual installations.

 - Costs of each installation or patch will be greatly reduced while removing human errors and adding improved repeatability.

 - Customer downtime is minimal due to automation of the installation process. IPA software automation is exponentially faster than manual installs.

 - IPA software will be reliably released at any time and provide the ability to recover from disasters.

 - ISS can affect business market share directly by implementing DevOps tools. Competitors are moving fast to increase speed of product delivery with DevOps. IPA will reduce waste, rework and minimize MTTR.  Projects will focus on work in progress (WIP) and IPA will maintain system stability.

 - IPA provides continuous environment feedback to all parties and tracks changes and trends. Solve problems quickly, fix issues as they occur and stay on top of customers needs with Installation Process Automated.


### Business process flow

**IPA**

 - IPA software creates a Tririga deliverable that is delivered from the master server to slave servers.  After implementation, IPA will continuously monitor installations, resolve errors, and send notifications to authorized administrators.
 - IPA allows automation of the Tririga installation process and includes more frequent updates to the database.
 - IPA enables rapid deployment of Tririga across multiple servers.
 - Includes the ability to run ad hoc jobs or scheduled jobs using tools such as Rundeck or Jenkins to control the environments from one location.
 - Automation of the installation process using a continuous delivery approach ensures reliably released software at any time and provides the ability to recover from disasters.
 
**OPA**
 - Automated migration of packages from source to destination server(s).
 - Ability to create object migration from database and then trigger export from source Tririga.
 - Export to destination servers and automatic installs are possible.
 - Multiple projects are manually reviewed, if needed, before import in destination server.
 - Updates to OPA are provided for each Tririga Application and Platform version update. 

**Fireball**

 - Monitor developer modifications across all objects.
  - Time tracking for developers working in Tririga.
  -  Monitor object customization growth over time which allows forward
   planning.
   - Workflow process monitoring during heavy loads to assess and manage
   performance.
   - Monitor external staging databases.
  -  Reports are generated and emailed to Admins (Excel, Birt, and
   Tableau reports available).
  -  Updates are provided for each Tririga Application and Platform
   version update.

 
**Sapphire**

  -  Sapphire reporting reduces the need for multiple query requests.
  -  Our reporting does client side data manipulation.
  -  Users access Tririga system and the values they return are cached in their browser in JavaScript objects.
  -  This allows for decreased chatter between clients and Tririga.
  -  Manipulation of large datasets is done on the clients browser.
  -  Reporting can run alone or as a part of Slate Fire INFINITY
  -  Reports are generated and emailed to Admins (Excel, Birt, and Tableau reports available).
  -  Updates are provided for each Tririga Application and Platform version update.

**Infinity**

> ##### INFINITY makes releases easy, reliable and reduces overall cost.

 1. INFINITY and Modules combined Benefits:

     -  ISS can achieve a built-in DevOps environment that does not require
    hours of meetings and staff time to manage.
      -  Your Tririga team can simply control Tririga processes from one place and know what is happening at all times.
      -  The amount of data and processes managed by INFINITY is truly INFINITE!
      -  There are no limits to the systems abilities if the projects are controlled and allowed to be continuously running and planned
    based on analysis reporting and metrics.
      -  ISS can know how many man hours are spent working in your environments and what objects are modified by your developers. This
    allows to adjust project timelines and realize actual development
    time expected for each customization.
      -  Business Logic evaluation identifies and reinstalls all customizations to your Tririga systems during upgrades.
      -  ISS can take a snapshot at the start of the project and multiple times throughout the DevOps cycle and know the QA is at
